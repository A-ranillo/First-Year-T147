JS Basic Rules:
    It is case-sensitive.
    Variable name connot start with a digit. (valid wariable names, $a, $_a _a, a)
    Cannot use rerserved words (eg var, let). Can contain letters, numbers, underscore and dollar sig,
    Use snake case (one_two_three) or Camel Case (firstName)
    Use meaningful variable names (stinky is not meaningful, but temp is).
