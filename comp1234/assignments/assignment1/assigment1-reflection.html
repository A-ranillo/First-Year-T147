    <li><p><strong>What Challenges did you encounter while creating the folders structure and linking to files and directories?</strong></p></li>
    <p>I wouldn’t say It’s challenging but it was just tedious because I have to keep checking frequently if my directory is correct, tabbing in and out programs. Especially when I keep forgetting that some href needs to be in my gblearn to be able to work and it took me 15 mins to realise that.</p>
   
    <br>

    <li><p><strong>How did you approach troubleshooting and debugging any broken links or references?</strong></p></li>
    <p>For checking if the links are broken I will upload my file first into my gblearn and try it there because locally you won’t have the same structure as gblearn. If it still isn’t fix I have to double check if the path in my href is correct or even modify it to be able to work.</p>
   
    <br>

    <li><p><strong>What did you learn about the relationship between HTML and file structure in web development projects?</strong></p></li>
    <p>I’ve learned that you always have to be mindful of your paths for your assets, links, html etc. There's nothing wrong with double checking.</p>
    
    <br>

    <li><p><strong>What did you find most challenging about the assignment, and how did you overcome it?</strong></p></li>
    <p>It’s mostly just being mindful of where the index.html is currently being opened. Either locally or in gblearn. What I’ve said previously it is hard to keep things organised.</p>
