    <li><p><strong>What Challenges did you encounter while creating the folders structure and linking to files and directories?</strong></p></li>
    <p>It's a matter of keeping track on where the files are and also naming.</p>
   
    <br>

    <li><p><strong>How did you approach troubleshooting and debugging any broken links or references?</strong></p></li>
    <p>For checking if the links are broken I will upload my file first into my gblearn and try it there because locally you won’t have the same structure as gblearn. If it still isn’t fix I have to double check if the path in my href is correct or even modify it to be able to work.</p>
   
    <br>

    <li><p><strong>What did you learn about the relationship between HTML and file structure in web development projects?</strong></p></li>
    <p>I’ve learned that you always have to be mindful of your paths for your assets, links, html etc. There's nothing wrong with double checking. Also keeping in mind the CSS syntax, "ID" and "Class" names for css.</p>
    
    <br>

    <li><p><strong>What did you find most challenging about the assignment, and how did you overcome it?</strong></p></li>
    <p>The most challenging I found about this assignment is mostly for having the finest of CSS; floats, width, height, overflow etc.</p>
